      <description>Chapter One It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.</description>

      <description>Now pleasing sleep had seal&amp;rsquo;d each mortal eye,
Stretch&amp;rsquo;d in the tents the Grecian leaders lie:
The immortals slumber&amp;rsquo;d on their thrones above;
All, but the ever-wakeful eyes of Jove.(76)
To honour Thetis&amp;rsquo; son he bends his care,
And plunge the Greeks in all the woes of war:
Then bids an empty phantom rise to sight,
And thus commands the vision of the night.
&amp;ldquo;Fly hence, deluding Dream! and light as air,(77)</description>
